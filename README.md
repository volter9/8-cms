8 CMS is the most simple, lightweight and fast file-flat CMS (content management system) in the world written in PHP.

8 CMS called «8 CMS», because that's how many lines of code in the core.

## How to install

To install 8 CMS, you have to download content of this git repository and upload 
those files on the hosting or put on local web server.

That's it. Just grab files and upload them. Simple!

### Requirements 

You'll need:

* Apache web server with support of mod_rewrite
* PHP5.3+

That's it.

## How to use

Well, you can figure it out by yourself. Apparently, it's the simplest CMS in the world :wink:
